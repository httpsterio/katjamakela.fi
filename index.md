introduction: |
  My name is Katja Mäkelä and I'm in the social work and healthcare line of work. On top of that, I do some teaching at JAMK. 

  I'm originally from Tampere, but currently I'm living in Jyväskylä with my husband and three dogs. I have been an entrepreneur since 1988 and in 1991 I moved to Denmark to start an international clothes importing company. 
  
  In 2001 I moved back to Finland and I have finished a masters degree in Social Sciences. I've been working in that fielt ever since.

  My experience is wide and varied and it has shaped my way of working. I always take quality, efficiency and customer service into consideration.
